# Doors OS

OS am devloping from scratch to understand low lvl programming and sys dev   
i dont want it to be a fad, so it will take as long as it needs to take

## Goals
after reading the [beginner mistakes](https://wiki.osdev.org/Beginner_Mistakes) and testing a bit in my [leanring repo](https://github.com/t-88/Code-Bongo-III/tree/main/os-dev), i knew i needed a end goal and i should do it the right way   
-   getting keyboad input
-   building a repl (read excute print loop)
-   making some game
and the most important goal is to learn and explore
